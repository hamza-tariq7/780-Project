# 780-Project
This project analyzes a rich dataset from Food.com to uncover the key factors that drive recipe popularity and user satisfaction.
# Recipe Analysis Project

## Executive Summary
This project explores recipe data to uncover trends in ingredients, preparation time, and popularity. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), we analyzed thousands of recipes to identify patterns in user ratings, ingredient composition, and descriptive language.

## Key Objectives
- Identify which recipe characteristics have the largest impact on ratings and popularity.
- Examine how nutritional content, ingredient complexity, and visibility are related to user satisfaction.

## Key Findings
- Popularity ≠ Satisfaction — Highly reviewed recipes aren't always the most highly rated. Visibility introduces a wider audience that can dilute average ratings.
- Simplicity drives preference — Recipes with 10–14 ingredients are most highly rated, indicating a sweet spot between flavor and practicality.
- Balance is optimal — Moderate amounts of calories and nutrients are linked to higher satisfaction; extremes (e.g., extremely high protein or fiber) yield lower ratings.
- Cooking time is not a limitation — Users value outcome quality over preparation time.
